# ERP-SDAC

Project Overview:
This ERP system was developed using the MVC-2 architecture, with Java (Servlets & JSP) for middleware, MySQL for the backend, and JSP, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend. The system includes separate dashboards for consumer-side and seller-side operations to manage import and export processes efficiently.

Project Features & Workflow:

1. System Architecture & Tech Stack:
   
Architecture: MVC-2 (Model-View-Controller)
Backend: MySQL (Database), Stored Procedures, Data Access Object (DAO) Pattern
Middleware: Java (Servlets & JSP)
Frontend: JSP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

2. Project Flow & Functionality:
   
User Authentication & Role Management:
Separate consumer-side and seller-side dashboards
Users log in using authentication mechanisms, directing them to the appropriate dashboard

Database Design & Integration:
Designed a comprehensive ER diagram to structure the database
Created multiple Stored Procedures in SQL for core functionalities like order management, inventory tracking, and transaction processing

Middleware Implementation (Business Logic):
Used Java Servlets to handle user requests and responses
Implemented the Data Access Object (DAO) Pattern to efficiently interact with the database and execute stored procedures

Frontend Development (User Interface):
Developed an interactive UI using JSP, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
Displayed dynamic data from the database using JSP and Servlets

Programming by Contract Approach & Modular Design:
Ensured system reliability and maintainability by following the Programming by Contract approach
Implemented a modular design, making the system scalable and easier to maintain
